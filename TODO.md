* Activity sidebar, as heroku application (it's dynamic and hence unjekyllable). github; twitter; others? http://peter-murach.github.com/github/ for a github api.
* RSS, Atom feeds could be implemented using the following: http://coyled.com/2010/07/05/jekyll-templates-for-atom-rss/
* Create and adjust CSS, maybe based on ideas from my current tumblr theme.
* Eventually, ditch the tumblr thing.
